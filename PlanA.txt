  -other
    * The system is designed to give exact ammount of bills, taxes, and other expenses.
    * Nowaday, every house has a meter to measure the electricity usage but they cant see the exact ammount of bills, taxes, and other expenses that they have to pay for the electricity usage.
    * And Every households are paying more than they should be paying for the electricity usage.
    * Thats why we created this system to help people save money by showing them the exact ammount of bills, taxes, and other expenses that they have to pay for the electricity usage.
    * Most households are using smart devices, why not integrate them into the system where they can be controlled and monitored there electricity usage.

  !!! The Design is Very Human. !!!
